# better-image-as-plane
A Blender 5.0 addon to reshape imported image-as-plane mesh based on the texture alpha, effectively minimizing the transparent part of the plane.

## Installation
1. Download the python script
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
3. Click on the dropdown at the top right > Install from disk
4. Select this python script you've just installed
5. Enable it in case it's not automatically enabled

## Usage
Press shift + A in the 3D viewport to bring the "Add menu," go to Images > Better Image as Plane

## Note
I made this script overnight so I can use Blender for 2d tweening animation. Hope you can find a good use for it.
